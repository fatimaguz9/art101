			<h1>Lab 12 - Conditionals</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to make a function on conditionals.
						The example on canvas used Hogwarts houses as an example, for my 
						site I did the four main houses in Game of Thrones. Everything was working 
						well, however I was having difficulty getting images to pop up along with the 
						descriptions of the houses. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Most of my problems where due to spelling isses in the JavaScript, which lead to issues  
					 with getting images to pop up along wiht the desctiption. I stayed after our Thursday class to ask
					Wes how to get the images to pop up.   </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Hopefully everything is working properly and the button says what house you
						are in along with the description/photo. 
					</p>
				<div class="input-output">
					<h2>Welcome to Westeros</h2>
					<p>Please enter your name for sorting your Game of Thrones house.</p>
					Enter Name:
