			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to work with our partner on 
						creating functions within the JavaScript and how to call on 
						the function. I had to experiment with the function element
						on the console since I would get confused on what needed to be 
						written. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem that arose was how to write the function in the JavaScript
						file. I referenced the canvas example to figure out what I missed on
					for the function to work. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Hopefully you can see the function/array answers below.</p>
