        <h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
        <p>The point of the lab was to create a local file into my computer and 
            create a new index.html file.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>I'm glad to say I understood the lab well and didn't have much trouble
            creating the file structue and index.hmtl file. I would have the occasional
            issue with the links, but I was able to fix it.</p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p> Hopefully you can see the index.html file I created. Here is the 
            file structure I made:</p>
