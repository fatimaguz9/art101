					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create pseudocode for javascript and breaking down easy tasks into pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>It was difficult breaking down the code for a simple game, since it felt like we were missing a step.
						Or if we were splitting the tasks correctly. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<pre><code>
						How to make horchata:
						//Search up recipe online/book
						//Look if you have appliances needed, if not purchase or make do with whatâ€™s available
						//Look at ingredients, purchase ingredients and gather ingredients into the kitchen 
					  //Use a blender
						//Combine rice, hot water, and cinnamon sticks into a blender 
						  //Blend until rice/cinnamon sticks are ground 
						  //Refrigerate overnight, at least 8 hours
						//Strain mixture into a mesh strainer over a pitcher
						   //Throw away rice left on strainer
					  //Stir milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and sugar into pitcher
						//Add ice to your preference
					  //Enjoy!

						Pong Arcade Game:
						//Create a board with a vertical dotted line 
						split in the middle of board
						//Create a numerical counter (points) on top 
						of board starting at 0 in the 
						middle of the two sections with counter staying 
						in an 8 X 5 pixel space
						//Create first player on the right side of dotted 
						line (3 pixel tall and 1 pixel long)
						//Create second player on the left side of dotted 
						line (3 pixel tall and 1 pixel long)
						//Create 1 pixel at the top of dotted line
						   //Pixel can move along the x and y axis
						   //Allow single pixel to move randomly
							(either to the left or right of dotted line)
						//Allow both players to move up and down on the y axis 
						   //Players can hit the pixel
							 //When pixel is hit by the player of the 
							 accompanying numerical 
							 counter on the same side, the counter goes
							 up by one number
						  //When a single player hits pixel, allow it to 
						  move to the other side 
						  of the dotted line
						  //When the pixel crosses the dotted line again, 
						  the other player can send 
						  pixel back across the dotted line
							//Each time pixel crosses the dotted line, allow 
							the pixel to increase its velocity
						//Continue this pattern until one player reaches 11 
						on the counter (points) 
						or pixel passes a player and goes off screen 
						//Counter starts back on 0 and game restarts pattern
