  //Strain mixture into a mesh strainer over a pitcher
     //Throw away rice left on strainer

  //Create a board with a vertical dotted line split in the middle of board
  //Create a numerical counter (points) on top of board starting at 0 in the middle of the two sections with counter staying in an 8 X 5 pixel space
  //Create first player on the right side of dotted line (3 pixel tall and 1 pixel long)
  //Create second player on the left side of dotted line (3 pixel tall and 1 pixel long)
  //Create 1 pixel at the top of dotted line
     //Pixel can move along the x and y axis
     //Allow single pixel to move randomly (either to the left or right of dotted line)
  //Allow both players to move up and down on the y axis 
     //Players can hit the pixel
       //When pixel is hit by the player of the accompanying numerical counter on the same side, the counter goes up by one number
    //When a single player hits pixel, allow it to move to the other side of the dotted line
    //When the pixel crosses the dotted line again, the other player can send pixel back across the dotted line
      //Each time pixel crosses the dotted line, allow the pixel to increase its velocity
  //Continue this pattern until one player reaches 11 on the counter (points) or pixel passes a player and goes off screen 
  //Counter starts back on 0 and game restarts pattern
