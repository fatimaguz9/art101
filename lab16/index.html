					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to experiment with JSON and API's. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>What problems arose? How did you solve them? 
						A problem that arose was trying to figure out the instructions of the lab. We were referencing 
						the example from the previous lecture and were able to figure out problems in our code. 
						I was getting confused with all the append features to the object, but with the lecture I was able to 
						figure out what I needed to write down.
