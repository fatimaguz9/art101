					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to debug old labs and fix any issues 
						in the code if the site wasn't working properly. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't have any issues since I referenced the newest labs to fix any issues,
						which were mainly spelling issues in the code. There was nothing to major to fix. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The debugging section has the two labs where I found errors. You should be able to see the 
						screenshots. </p>
					<div id="output"></div>
