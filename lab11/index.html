			<h1>Lab 11- JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of the lab was to experiment with JS events. For the bonus task
						I attempted the glitch button with the timeout. I did try to do the anagram function
						but was having trouble with it.  
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I was having so many problems with trying to get the anagram to work. I woukd try different
						methods through W3schools, WesBot, and other sources, but it didn't seem to work for me. 
						It was mainly errors through the console and I wouln't know how to solve the issue. So I did the 
						glitch effect which I was sucessfuly able to do. Some erros with the effects shaking my screen, but
						I was able to figure out that it should be in the same bracket if I want the effect to only work
						when the button is pressed. 
					</p>
			</div>
	
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The site should be working and the buttons should be working properly. Press the dance button.</p>
					<div id="output">
						<input type="text" id="user-name" placeholder="Write Text">
						<button id="submit">Submit</button>
						<button onclick="glitch()">Dance Button</button>
					</div>	
					<script>
						function glitch() {
						  var body = document.body;
						  var angle = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 5; 
						  var translateX = (Math.random() - .4) * window.innerWidth /10; 
						var translateY = (Math.random() - .3) * window.innerHeight /10;
						body.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg) translate(${translateX}px, ${translateY}px)`;
						setTimeout(function () {
							body.style.transform = '';
						}, Math.random()*50);}
