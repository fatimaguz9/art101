			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<h2> Hello, I'm Fatima and I am an art major and haven't had any past experience coding.
				This is my first time so hopefully the computer/website doesn't explode.</h2>

			<h2>Heya, the name's Judah. Probably currently either too hot or cold (it's a constant struggle).
				I baked a potato recently (as of writing this) and it turns out you have to put a lot of things
			inside a potato to make it actually taste good because on its own a potato kinda tastes like shit.
		    Still love potatos though!</h2>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenges of this lab in particular were to figure out how to use HTML and CSS.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Fatima: A problem I encountered was relearning how to type in code since I had to switch 
						over from an ipad to a chromebook. It's definitely werid, but looking back at the lecture 
						and slides helped a lot.</p>
						<p> Judah: The personal biggest issue for me was figuring out we were supposed to do within 
							the assignment's guidelines. The struturing and writing of the code was a bit
							unintuitive, but we were able to figure it out pretty quickly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Fatima: The assignment was difficult at first, but the slow introduction to HTML and CSS
						definitely made it easier to understand. Still diffucult, but easier. There was enough energy
					to get through the assignment and learn how to work with the languages. </p>
					<p> Judah: This assignment was quite interesting as an introduction to the structures of HTML and
						CSS, as well as coding in general. It helped that the templates were given were so through,
						though that throughness was also a source of some confusion, as it made the desired results 
						of this lab somewhat unclear, especially compared to some of the base examples given in Canvas.

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Hopefully our website worked out and didn't crash. </p>
